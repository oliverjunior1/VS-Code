'''In the previous lesson we have seen how error handling is usually implemented in Python. For this exercise, however, 
I'll need you to do it in a slightly different way so that it can be tested: you'll need to implement it INSIDE the function. In the form 
of a comment, you will see an example resolution. Keep in mind, however, that the preferred form is the one 
we've seen in class.
For the following sum_num() function, implement a simple error handler that, in case of any error, prints 
the message: "Unexpected error" on the screen. Otherwise, it should limit itself to displaying the result of 
the sum between the two numbers given as arguments.'''
try:
    def sum_num(x, y):
        # Atenção: os parênteses estavam desbalanceados na sua chamada
        return x + y
    print(sum_num(int(input("Put the first number: ")), int(input("Put the second number: "))))
except ValueError:
    print("Unexpected error")
